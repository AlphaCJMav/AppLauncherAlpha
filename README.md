Script to Create .desktop Launchers on Linux

This Python script allows you to create .desktop files for applications on Linux systems. .desktop files are used to define applications and their properties in the desktop environment. I created this script because I couldn't find any information online, especially for Gnome when it doesnâ€™t have the option to create a launcher.

I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me.

THANK YOU
